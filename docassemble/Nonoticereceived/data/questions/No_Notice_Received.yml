continue button field: No_Notice_Received_intro
question: |
  Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgement or Motion to Dimiss for Failure to       Properly Terminate Tenancy
subquestion: |
  If your landlord is taking you to court to evict you and **if you did not receive the Notice To Quit or Notice to Terminate Your Tenancy or 30 day or 14 day notice**, you should use this form. Before your landlord can file an eviction case, they first have to file a Notice to Quit with either 30 days or 14 days notice. 
  
  This is a form for a tenant's motion for summary judgement or a motion to         dismiss for failure to properly serve notice to terminate tenancy.
  
  **Before filling out this form, make sure you have the name of your landlord who started this claim, the court that you will be going to, and the docket       number issued to you.**
  
  After filling out this form you will be able to download a PDF of the Motion to   submit regarding your case.
